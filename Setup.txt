Open a new terminal in VS Code. (Menu bar and click on Terminal --> New Terminal. A terminal should open at bottom)
Install 'virtualenv' package: 
'pip install virtualenv'

Create a new virtual environment. Run this in the terminal:
'virtualenv scraper-env'

Activate the virtual environment on windows:
'scraper-env\Scripts\activate'

You should see the virtual environment name '(scraper-env)' at the beginning of your terminal line, indicating that it is active.

Install the required packages in the virtual environment:

'pip install selenium ipython'

Lastly, create a new Python file in VS Code. seleniumproject.py and put the scraping code in that.
