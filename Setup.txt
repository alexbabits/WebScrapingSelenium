Open a new terminal in VS Code. (Menu bar and click on Terminal --> New Terminal. A terminal should open at bottom)
Install 'virtualenv' package: 
'pip install virtualenv'

Create a virtual environment in my project folder:
This command uses the full path of the 'virtualenv.exe' script to create a virtual environment named 'scraper-env' in my project folder.
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python310\Scripts\virtualenv.exe scraper-env

Activate the virtual environment on windows:
'.\scraper-env\Scripts\Activate'

You should see the virtual environment name '(scraper-env)' at the beginning of your terminal line, indicating that it is active.

Install the required packages in the virtual environment:

'pip install selenium ipython'

Lastly, create new python file and put the scraping code in that.
